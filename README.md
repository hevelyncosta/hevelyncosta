Hi, I'm Hévelyn. Currently, I'm pursuing an undergraduate degree in *Information Systems*. I also have [music](https://repositorio.ufmg.br/handle/1843/BUOS-APVNLH) as my first background, and I've worked in the field for over 15 years. I believe my years of dedication to music, both academically and on stage, enable me to collaborate creatively with peers and excel in delivering projects with simplicity. I'm curious about both learning new technologies, and the learning process itself.
